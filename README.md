Auto-start functionality is not included yet. To use BrightnessControl, configure Windows to start it at boot and then use Alt+Plus or Alt+Minus to change brightness and contrast. Alternatively, you can open the brightness / contrast overlay by clicking on the system tray icon. You can change the predefined hotkeys in the settings accessible via the system tray icon context menu.
