# BrightnessControl
BrightnessControl allows you to change your monitor's brightness settings via keyboard hotkeys.

Auto-start or configuration functionality is not included yet. To use BrightnessControl, configure Windows to start it at boot and then use Alt+Plus or Alt+Minus to change brightness and contrast. Alternatively, you can open the brightness / contrast overlay by clicking on the system tray icon.
